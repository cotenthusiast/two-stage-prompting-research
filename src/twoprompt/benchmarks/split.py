    Build a stratified split by sampling a fixed number of questions per subject.

    The input DataFrame is expected to be the normalized canonical question table.
    This function filters the dataset to the requested subjects, removes any
    question IDs already present in ``exclude_ids``, and samples
    ``per_subject`` questions without replacement from each subject.

    Subject rows are sorted by ``question_id`` before sampling so that the
